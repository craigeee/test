      name: zuora-track-id

      description: >-
        A custom identifier for tracking API requests. If you set a value for
        this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response header. This
        header enables you to track your API calls to assist with
        troubleshooting in the event of an issue. The value of this field must
        use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any of the following
        characters: colon (:), semicolon (;), double quote ("), or quote (').

        An entity ID. If you have Multi-entity enabled and the authorization
        token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to
        specify which entity to perform the operation on. If the authorization
        token is only valid for a single entity or you do not have Multi-entity
        enabled, you do not need to set this header.

      description: >-
        Specify a unique idempotency key if you want to perform an idempotent
        POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other request types.
        This idempotency key should be a unique value, and the Zuora server
        identifies subsequent retries of the same request using this value. For
        more information, see [Idempotent
        Requests](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/quickstart-api/tag/Idempotent-Requests/).

      description: >-
        Include a `accept-encoding: gzip` header to compress responses, which
        can reduce the bandwidth required for a response. If specified, Zuora
        automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes. For
        more information about this header, see [Request and Response
        Compression](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/quickstart-api/tag/Request-and-Response-Compression/).

        a gzipped file for the payload if you specify this header. For more
        information, see [Request and Response
        Compression](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/quickstart-api/tag/Request-and-Response-Compression/).

    async:

      name: async
      required: false
      description: >-
        Making asynchronous requests allows you to scale your applications more
        efficiently by leveraging Zuora's infrastructure to enqueue and execute
        requests for you without blocking. These requests also use built-in
        retry semantics, which makes them much less likely to fail for
        non-deterministic reasons, even in extreme high-throughput scenarios.
        Meanwhile, when you send a request to one of these endpoints, you can
        expect to receive a response in less than 150 milliseconds and these
        calls are unlikely to trigger rate limit errors. If set to true, Zuora
        returns a 202 Accepted response, and the response body contains only a
        request ID.

            specified, the payment number will be passed in instead. Gateways
            check duplicates on the gateway order ID to ensure that the merchant
            do not accidentally enter the same transaction twice. This ID can
            also be used to do reconciliation and tie the payment to a natural
            key in external systems. The source of this ID varies by merchant.
            Some merchants use their shopping cart order IDs, and others use
            something different. Merchants use this ID to track transactions in
            their eCommerce systems. When you create a payment for capturing the
            authorized funds, it is highly recommended to pass in the
            `gateway_order_id` that you used when authorizing the funds by using
            the Create authorization operation, together with the
            `authorization_id` field.

            scenarios. Meanwhile, when you send a request to one of these
            endpoints, you can expect to receive a response in less than 150
            milliseconds and these calls are unlikely to trigger rate limit
            errors. If set to true, Zuora returns a 202 Accepted response, and
            the response body contains only a request ID.

            header. This header enables you to track your API calls to assist
            with troubleshooting in the event of an issue. The value of this
            field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any
            of the following characters: colon (:), semicolon (;), double quote
            ("), or quote (').

          description: >-
            Making asynchronous requests allows you to scale your applications
            more efficiently by leveraging Zuora's infrastructure to enqueue and
            execute requests for you without blocking. These requests also use
            built-in retry semantics, which makes them much less likely to fail
            for non-deterministic reasons, even in extreme high-throughput
            scenarios. Meanwhile, when you send a request to one of these
            endpoints, you can expect to receive a response in less than 150
            milliseconds and these calls are unlikely to trigger rate limit
            errors. If set to true, Zuora returns a 202 Accepted response, and
            the response body contains only a request ID.

            authorization token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not
            have multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.

            the Zuora server identifies subsequent retries of the same request

            the list, which can be either ascending (e.g. `account_number.asc`)
            or descending (e.g. `account_number.desc`). You cannot sort on
            properties that are arrays. If the array-type properties are
            specified for the `sort[]` parameter, they are ignored.

            header. This header enables you to track your API calls to assist
            with troubleshooting in the event of an issue. The value of this
            field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any
            of the following characters: colon (:), semicolon (;), double quote
            ("), or quote (').

          description: >-
            Making asynchronous requests allows you to scale your applications
            more efficiently by leveraging Zuora's infrastructure to enqueue and
            execute requests for you without blocking. These requests also use
            built-in retry semantics, which makes them much less likely to fail
            for non-deterministic reasons, even in extreme high-throughput
            scenarios. Meanwhile, when you send a request to one of these
            endpoints, you can expect to receive a response in less than 150
            milliseconds and these calls are unlikely to trigger rate limit
            errors. If set to true, Zuora returns a 202 Accepted response, and
            the response body contains only a request ID.

            authorization token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not
            have multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.

            header. This header enables you to track your API calls to assist
            with troubleshooting in the event of an issue. The value of this
            field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any
            of the following characters: colon (:), semicolon (;), double quote
            ("), or quote (').

          description: >-
            Making asynchronous requests allows you to scale your applications
            more efficiently by leveraging Zuora's infrastructure to enqueue and
            execute requests for you without blocking. These requests also use
            built-in retry semantics, which makes them much less likely to fail
            for non-deterministic reasons, even in extreme high-throughput
            scenarios. Meanwhile, when you send a request to one of these
            endpoints, you can expect to receive a response in less than 150
            milliseconds and these calls are unlikely to trigger rate limit
            errors. If set to true, Zuora returns a 202 Accepted response, and
            the response body contains only a request ID.

            authorization token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not
            have multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.

            the Zuora server identifies subsequent retries of the same request
            using this value. For more information, see [Idempotent

            Making asynchronous requests allows you to scale your applications
            more efficiently by leveraging Zuora's infrastructure to enqueue and
            execute requests for you without blocking. These requests also use
            built-in retry semantics, which makes them much less likely to fail
            for non-deterministic reasons, even in extreme high-throughput
            scenarios. Meanwhile, when you send a request to one of these
            endpoints, you can expect to receive a response in less than 150
            milliseconds and these calls are unlikely to trigger rate limit
            errors. If set to true, Zuora returns a 202 Accepted response, and

            Making asynchronous requests allows you to scale your applications

            execute requests for you without blocking. These requests also use
            built-in retry semantics, which makes them much less likely to fail
            for non-deterministic reasons, even in extreme high-throughput
            scenarios. Meanwhile, when you send a request to one of these
            endpoints, you can expect to receive a response in less than 150
            milliseconds and these calls are unlikely to trigger rate limit
            errors. If set to true, Zuora returns a 202 Accepted response, and
            the response body contains only a request ID.

            have multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.

            header. This header enables you to track your API calls to assist
            with troubleshooting in the event of an issue. The value of this
            field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any
            of the following characters: colon (:), semicolon (;), double quote
            ("), or quote (').

          description: >-
            Making asynchronous requests allows you to scale your applications
            more efficiently by leveraging Zuora's infrastructure to enqueue and
            execute requests for you without blocking. These requests also use
            built-in retry semantics, which makes them much less likely to fail
            for non-deterministic reasons, even in extreme high-throughput
            scenarios. Meanwhile, when you send a request to one of these
            endpoints, you can expect to receive a response in less than 150
            milliseconds and these calls are unlikely to trigger rate limit
            errors. If set to true, Zuora returns a 202 Accepted response, and
            the response body contains only a request ID.

            authorization token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not
            have multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.

            the Zuora server identifies subsequent retries of the same request

            header. This header enables you to track your API calls to assist
            with troubleshooting in the event of an issue. The value of this
            field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any
            of the following characters: colon (:), semicolon (;), double quote
            ("), or quote (').

          description: >-
            Making asynchronous requests allows you to scale your applications
            more efficiently by leveraging Zuora's infrastructure to enqueue and
            execute requests for you without blocking. These requests also use
            built-in retry semantics, which makes them much less likely to fail
            for non-deterministic reasons, even in extreme high-throughput
            scenarios. Meanwhile, when you send a request to one of these
            endpoints, you can expect to receive a response in less than 150
            milliseconds and these calls are unlikely to trigger rate limit
            errors. If set to true, Zuora returns a 202 Accepted response, and
            the response body contains only a request ID.

            authorization token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not
            have multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.

            A custom identifier for tracking API requests. If you set a value
            for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response
            header. This header enables you to track your API calls to assist
            with troubleshooting in the event of an issue. The value of this
            field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any
            of the following characters: colon (:), semicolon (;), double quote
            ("), or quote (').

          description: >-
            Making asynchronous requests allows you to scale your applications
            more efficiently by leveraging Zuora's infrastructure to enqueue and
            execute requests for you without blocking. These requests also use
            built-in retry semantics, which makes them much less likely to fail
            for non-deterministic reasons, even in extreme high-throughput
            scenarios. Meanwhile, when you send a request to one of these
            endpoints, you can expect to receive a response in less than 150
            milliseconds and these calls are unlikely to trigger rate limit
            errors. If set to true, Zuora returns a 202 Accepted response, and
            the response body contains only a request ID.

            An entity ID. If you have multi-entity enabled and the authorization
            token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to
            specify which entity to perform the operation on. If the
            authorization token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not
            have multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.

            idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other
            request types. This idempotency key should be a unique value, and
            the Zuora server identifies subsequent retries of the same request
            using this value. For more information, see [Idempotent

            for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response
            header. This header enables you to track your API calls to assist
            with troubleshooting in the event of an issue. The value of this
            field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any
            of the following characters: colon (:), semicolon (;), double quote
            ("), or quote (').

          description: >-
            Making asynchronous requests allows you to scale your applications
            more efficiently by leveraging Zuora's infrastructure to enqueue and
            execute requests for you without blocking. These requests also use
            built-in retry semantics, which makes them much less likely to fail
            for non-deterministic reasons, even in extreme high-throughput
            scenarios. Meanwhile, when you send a request to one of these
            endpoints, you can expect to receive a response in less than 150
            milliseconds and these calls are unlikely to trigger rate limit
            errors. If set to true, Zuora returns a 202 Accepted response, and
            the response body contains only a request ID.

            authorization token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not
            have multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.

            the Zuora server identifies subsequent retries of the same request
            using this value. For more information, see [Idempotent

            with troubleshooting in the event of an issue. The value of this
            field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any
            of the following characters: colon (:), semicolon (;), double quote

            Making asynchronous requests allows you to scale your applications
            more efficiently by leveraging Zuora's infrastructure to enqueue and
            execute requests for you without blocking. These requests also use
            built-in retry semantics, which makes them much less likely to fail
            for non-deterministic reasons, even in extreme high-throughput
            scenarios. Meanwhile, when you send a request to one of these
            endpoints, you can expect to receive a response in less than 150
            milliseconds and these calls are unlikely to trigger rate limit
            errors. If set to true, Zuora returns a 202 Accepted response, and
            the response body contains only a request ID.

            have multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.

            A custom identifier for tracking API requests. If you set a value
            for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response
            header. This header enables you to track your API calls to assist
            with troubleshooting in the event of an issue. The value of this
            field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any
            of the following characters: colon (:), semicolon (;), double quote
            ("), or quote (').

          description: >-
            Making asynchronous requests allows you to scale your applications
            more efficiently by leveraging Zuora's infrastructure to enqueue and
            execute requests for you without blocking. These requests also use
            built-in retry semantics, which makes them much less likely to fail
            for non-deterministic reasons, even in extreme high-throughput
            scenarios. Meanwhile, when you send a request to one of these
            endpoints, you can expect to receive a response in less than 150
            milliseconds and these calls are unlikely to trigger rate limit
            errors. If set to true, Zuora returns a 202 Accepted response, and
            the response body contains only a request ID.

            token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to
            specify which entity to perform the operation on. If the
            authorization token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not
            have multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.

            idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other
            request types. This idempotency key should be a unique value, and
            the Zuora server identifies subsequent retries of the same request
            using this value. For more information, see [Idempotent

            A custom identifier for tracking API requests. If you set a value
            for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response
            header. This header enables you to track your API calls to assist
            with troubleshooting in the event of an issue. The value of this
            field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any
            of the following characters: colon (:), semicolon (;), double quote
            ("), or quote (').

          description: >-
            Making asynchronous requests allows you to scale your applications
            more efficiently by leveraging Zuora's infrastructure to enqueue and
            execute requests for you without blocking. These requests also use
            built-in retry semantics, which makes them much less likely to fail
            for non-deterministic reasons, even in extreme high-throughput
            scenarios. Meanwhile, when you send a request to one of these
            endpoints, you can expect to receive a response in less than 150
            milliseconds and these calls are unlikely to trigger rate limit
            errors. If set to true, Zuora returns a 202 Accepted response, and
            the response body contains only a request ID.

            An entity ID. If you have multi-entity enabled and the authorization
            token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to
            specify which entity to perform the operation on. If the
            authorization token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not
            have multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.

            idempotent POST or PATCH request. Do not use this header in other
            request types. This idempotency key should be a unique value, and
            the Zuora server identifies subsequent retries of the same request
            using this value. For more information, see [Idempotent
            Requests](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/quickstart-api/tag/Idempotent-Requests/).

            header. This header enables you to track your API calls to assist
            with troubleshooting in the event of an issue. The value of this
            field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any
            of the following characters: colon (:), semicolon (;), double quote
            ("), or quote (').

            Making asynchronous requests allows you to scale your applications
            more efficiently by leveraging Zuora's infrastructure to enqueue and
            execute requests for you without blocking. These requests also use
            built-in retry semantics, which makes them much less likely to fail
            for non-deterministic reasons, even in extreme high-throughput
            scenarios. Meanwhile, when you send a request to one of these
            endpoints, you can expect to receive a response in less than 150
            milliseconds and these calls are unlikely to trigger rate limit
            errors. If set to true, Zuora returns a 202 Accepted response, and
            the response body contains only a request ID.

            authorization token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not
            have multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.

            the Zuora server identifies subsequent retries of the same request

            with troubleshooting in the event of an issue. The value of this
            field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any
            of the following characters: colon (:), semicolon (;), double quote

          description: >-
            Making asynchronous requests allows you to scale your applications
            more efficiently by leveraging Zuora's infrastructure to enqueue and
            execute requests for you without blocking. These requests also use
            built-in retry semantics, which makes them much less likely to fail
            for non-deterministic reasons, even in extreme high-throughput
            scenarios. Meanwhile, when you send a request to one of these
            endpoints, you can expect to receive a response in less than 150
            milliseconds and these calls are unlikely to trigger rate limit
            errors. If set to true, Zuora returns a 202 Accepted response, and
            the response body contains only a request ID.

            authorization token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not
            have multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.

            header. This header enables you to track your API calls to assist
            with troubleshooting in the event of an issue. The value of this
            field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any
            of the following characters: colon (:), semicolon (;), double quote

          description: >-
            Making asynchronous requests allows you to scale your applications
            more efficiently by leveraging Zuora's infrastructure to enqueue and
            execute requests for you without blocking. These requests also use
            built-in retry semantics, which makes them much less likely to fail
            for non-deterministic reasons, even in extreme high-throughput
            scenarios. Meanwhile, when you send a request to one of these
            endpoints, you can expect to receive a response in less than 150
            milliseconds and these calls are unlikely to trigger rate limit
            errors. If set to true, Zuora returns a 202 Accepted response, and
            the response body contains only a request ID.

            authorization token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not
            have multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.

            the Zuora server identifies subsequent retries of the same request
            using this value. For more information, see [Idempotent

            header. This header enables you to track your API calls to assist
            with troubleshooting in the event of an issue. The value of this
            field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any
            of the following characters: colon (:), semicolon (;), double quote

          description: >-
            Making asynchronous requests allows you to scale your applications
            more efficiently by leveraging Zuora's infrastructure to enqueue and
            execute requests for you without blocking. These requests also use
            built-in retry semantics, which makes them much less likely to fail
            for non-deterministic reasons, even in extreme high-throughput
            scenarios. Meanwhile, when you send a request to one of these
            endpoints, you can expect to receive a response in less than 150
            milliseconds and these calls are unlikely to trigger rate limit
            errors. If set to true, Zuora returns a 202 Accepted response, and
            the response body contains only a request ID.

            with troubleshooting in the event of an issue. The value of this
            field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any
            of the following characters: colon (:), semicolon (;), double quote

          description: >-
            Making asynchronous requests allows you to scale your applications
            more efficiently by leveraging Zuora's infrastructure to enqueue and
            execute requests for you without blocking. These requests also use
            built-in retry semantics, which makes them much less likely to fail
            for non-deterministic reasons, even in extreme high-throughput
            scenarios. Meanwhile, when you send a request to one of these
            endpoints, you can expect to receive a response in less than 150
            milliseconds and these calls are unlikely to trigger rate limit
            errors. If set to true, Zuora returns a 202 Accepted response, and
            the response body contains only a request ID.

            authorization token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not
            have multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.

            for this header, Zuora returns the same value in the response
            header. This header enables you to track your API calls to assist
            with troubleshooting in the event of an issue. The value of this
            field must use the US-ASCII character set and must not include any
            of the following characters: colon (:), semicolon (;), double quote
            ("), or quote (').

          description: >-
            Making asynchronous requests allows you to scale your applications
            more efficiently by leveraging Zuora's infrastructure to enqueue and
            execute requests for you without blocking. These requests also use
            built-in retry semantics, which makes them much less likely to fail
            for non-deterministic reasons, even in extreme high-throughput
            scenarios. Meanwhile, when you send a request to one of these
            endpoints, you can expect to receive a response in less than 150
            milliseconds and these calls are unlikely to trigger rate limit
            errors. If set to true, Zuora returns a 202 Accepted response, and
            the response body contains only a request ID.

            token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to
            specify which entity to perform the operation on. If the
            authorization token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not
            have multi-entity enabled, you do not need to set this header.

            request types. This idempotency key should be a unique value, and
            the Zuora server identifies subsequent retries of the same request
            using this value. For more information, see [Idempotent

      If you do not have a Zuora tenant, go to

      and sign up for a test drive.

  - name: Authentication
    description: >-
      The Zuora API uses OAuth tokens to authenticate requests. You can view and
      manage the client credentials the API libraries use to generate these
      tokens for you in Zuora Central.


      Take the following steps to create authentication credentials and add them
      to your server-side code:



      1. Create a dedicated user for making API calls. See [Create an API
      user](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Tenant_Management/A_Administrator_Settings/Manage_Users/Create_an_API_User)
      for details. This step must be performed by a Zuora administrator from
      your organization who has a company email address.

      2. Create an OAuth client for the user. This step must be performed by an
      administrator.
          1. In Zuora, navigate to **Settings > Administration > Manage Users**, and click the user name (in hypertext) that is created in step 1.
          2. In the New OAuth Client section on the user profile page, enter a client name, and click create. A new window will open showing the client ID and client secret.
          3. Note down the client ID and client secret. You’ll need them to configure your client. This is a one-time process. See Create an OAuth client for a user for details.
      3. If you use cURL or other JSON based API applications, you have to
      [generate an OAuth
      token](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/api/operation/createToken/)
      and use the returned `access_token` to create subsequent API requests.

      If you want to use Zuora Java client library, configure the library with
      your keys so that it can make requests to the Zuora API.


      See the following code samples to understand how to authenticate:


      **Java**


      ```

      String CLIENT_ID = "16f143d3-9887-484f-aaa7-37f0c3a24f3b";

      String CLIENT_SECRET = "gMOlKhy43P/cKjxXR+J4";

      String ENDPOINT = ZuoraEnv.SBX;

      ZuoraClient zuoraClient = new ZuoraClient(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET,
      ENDPOINT);


      ```


      To protect your tenant from unauthorized access be sure not to share your
      credentials in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub or client-side
      code.


      All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will
      fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.
  - name: Errors
    description: >-
      Zuora uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or
      failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the 2xx range indicate
      success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the
      information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a payment
      attempt failed, etc.). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with
      Zuora's servers.


      Some 4xx errors that could be handled programmatically include an error
      code that briefly explains the error reported.


      **Attributes**


      - **type** (enum)


      - **code** (string): For some errors that could be handled
      programmatically, a short string indicating the error code reported.


      - **message** (string): A human-readable message providing more details
      about the error. 


      - **param** (string)


      If the error is parameter-specific, the parameter related to the error.
      For example, you can use this to display a message near the correct form
      field.


      **Related guide**: See the [Error
      Handling](https://developer.zuora.com/quickstart-api/tutorial/error-handling/)
      section in the Quickstart API Tutorials.
  - name: Expanding Responses
    description: >
      Many objects allow you to request additional information as an expanded
      response by using the `expand[]` request parameter. This parameter is
      available for all GET requests. 


      In some cases, there is related information not included in responses by
      default, for example, the Invoice data associated with an Account object.
      You can request these fields as an expanded response by using the
      `expand[]` query parameter.

      You can also expand recursively by specifying nested fields after a dot
      (`.`). For example, requesting `billing_documents.payment_method` on an
      account will expand the billing documents attribute into a list of full
      Billing Document objects, and will then expand the `payment_method`
      attribute on those billing documents into a full Payment Method object.


      Moreover, you have the flexibility to expand multiple objects at once by
      identifying multiple items in the `expand[]` array.



      Expansions have a maximum depth of three levels. Therefore, when listing
      accounts, a value like
      `accounts.subscriptions.subscription_plans.subscription_items` is the
      deepest allowed for the `expand[]` field.



      **Related Guide**: See the [Expand
      responses](https://developer.zuora.com/quickstart-api/tutorial/expand-responses/)
      section in the Quickstart API Tutorials.
  - name: Pagination
    description: >-
      All top-level API resources have support for bulk fetches via the "List"
      API methods. For instance, you can list accounts, list subscriptions and
      list billing documents. These list API methods share a common structure -
      taking an optional `cursor` parameter.


      Zuora uses cursor-based pagination via the `cursor` query parameter. The
      cursor parameter takes the `next_page` value returned in the response
      returned from a previous request. Objects are returned, by default, in
      reverse chronological order. 



      **Parameters**


      `cursor`(string): a cursor for use in pagination. cursor defines your
      place in the list. For instance, if you make a "List" request and receive
      10 objects, with `next_page=76683efa-4b25-4716-a5c1-852b2162fcdb`, your
      subsequent call can include `cursor=76683efa-4b25-4716-a5c1-852b2162fcdb`
      to fetch the next page of the list.


      **List Response Format**


      - `data`(array): an array containing the actual response elements,
      paginated by any request parameters.

        The default `page_size` value for all "List" endpoints is 30, except for the [List billing documents](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/quickstart-api/operation/getBillingDocuments/) operation. The `page_size` parameter is not fully supported by the "List billing documents" operation. By default, you will get between 30 and 90 billing documents for each page when calling this operation.
        

      - `next_page`(string): a cursor you can use to fetch the next page of the
      list.
  - name: Request Ids
    description: >-
      Each API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this
      value in the response headers under `zuora-request-Id`. 

      If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request
      identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.
  - name: Idempotent Requests
    description: >+
      The Zuora API supports idempotency that prevents the same operation from
      being performed multiple times by accident. For example, when you attempt
      to create a product using the [Create a
      product](https://developer.zuora.com/api-references/quickstart-api/operation/createProduct/)
      operation but no response is returned because of the network issue, you
      can retry the request using the same idempotency key to ensure that only
      one product is created.
       
      To perform an idempotent request, provide an additional `idempotency-key`
      header in the request. This idempotency key should be a unique value and
      the Zuora server identifies subsequent retries of the same request using
      this value. The value should be less than 255 characters long.


      When you submit a request with the `idempotency-key` specified, the
      resulting status code, headers, and the body of this request is saved
      regardless of whether it succeeded or failed. Subsequent requests with the
      same key return the same result. A created idempotency key is
      automatically removed from the system 24 hours after it is set. 


      All `POST` and `PATCH` requests accept idempotency keys. Because the
      `OPTIONS`, `HEAD`, `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests are intrinsically
      idempotent, you should not specify the `idempotency-key` header in these
      requests.


      Note that the following HTTP status codes are specific to using the
      `idempotency-key` header:

      - **409 Conflict**: Usually caused by submitting concurrent requests for
      the same cached data while the request is still in progress.

      - **422 Unprocessable Content**: Usually caused by a mismatch of tenant
      IDs, URLs or HTTP methods.
       


       
       

  - name: Request and Response Compression
    description: >-

      **Request Compression**


      Include the `content-encoding: gzip` header if you want to compress a
      request. 


      With this header specified, you should upload a gzipped file for the
      request payload instead of sending the JSON payload. Zuora will decompress
      the request payload before processing.



      **Response Compression**


      Zuora compresses a response if the request contains an `accept-encoding:

      Zuora automatically compresses responses that contain over 1000 bytes of

  - name: Bill Runs
    description: >-
      Bill runs automatically create invoices for your customers on a set
      schedule, as well as create invoices for your customers, as needed. A bill
      run gathers information from one or more customer accounts and generates
      invoices for those accounts.                     The operations in this
      section allows you to create, update, get, or delete bill runs.
  - name: Bill Run Previews
    description: >-
      The Bill Run Previews operations allow you to generates a preview of
      future billing document items for a batch of accounts through a bill
      run.           A bill run preivew job also generates a downloadable CSV
      file containing a preview of invoice item data for the customer account
      batch.

    description: ' **Note: The API operations in this section have been deprecated.**           <p>          Billing Documents represent your customer''s invoices, credit memos and debit memos. Invoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription. They contain invoice items, and proration adjustments that may be caused by changes to a subscription. If your invoice is configured to be charged automatically, Zuora automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment otherwise Zuora will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. Any customer credit memos may be applied before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be charged).</p>'

      [Invoices](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Zuora_Billing/Billing_and_Payments/IA_Invoices/A1_Invoice_Introduction).
  - name: Credit Memos
    description: >-
      Credit memos reduce invoice and account balances. By applying one or more
      credit memos to invoices with positive balances, you can reduce the
      invoice balances in the same way as applying a payment to an invoice. For
      more information about credit memos, see [Credit and debit
      memos](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/B_Credit_and_Debit_Memos).
  - name: Debit Memos

      Debit memos increase the amount a customer owes. Debit memos can be used
      to correct undercharging on an invoice or to levy ad hoc charges outside
      the context of a subscription. Just like an invoice, debit memo balances
      can be settled by applying either a payment or a credit memo. For more
      information about debit memos, see [Credit and debit
      memos](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/B_Credit_and_Debit_Memos).

  - name: Payment Methods
    description: >-

      the information about a payment, including the payment amount and which
      billing documents the payment is applied to.
  - name: Payment Runs
    description: >-
      Payment runs are used to collect payments using electronic payment
      methods. Even if a payment was made to an invoice but had an error, if an
      invoice has a positive balance and meets all the filter criteria for the
      payment run, Zuora will pick up the invoice for processing in the payment
      run. <br/>        Zuora supports two type of payment runs: ad hoc and
      recurring. These are similar to ad hoc and scheduled bill runs
  - name: Payment Schedules
    description: >-
      The Payment Schedules feature enables you to collect a series of payments
      following customized timelines and rules. You have the flexibility to
      leverage a payment schedule to process either a single payment or multiple
      payments.          <br/>          You can leverage this feature to split
      invoice or account balances into several installments, and then
      automatically process payments for the installments. Payment schedules can
      also be used to collect external payments made for the installments.
      Meanwhile, we’ve provided you the capability to easily manage and modify
      existing schedules, as well as to manually retry failed payments with
      updated configurations.
  - name: Payment Schedule Items
    description: >-
      A payment schedule consists of one or more payment schedule items that can
      be picked up by payment runs, which are hourly scheduled by Zuora. Each
      payment schedule item will trigger a payment process.
  - name: Refunds
    description: >-
      A refund returns money to a customer. For instance, refunds are used when
      a customer cancels service and is no longer your customer.         The
      Quickstart API allows you to refund payments, update refunds, and get
      refunds.
  - name: Products
    description: >-
      Products describe the specific goods or services you offer to your
      customers and help you track inventory or provisioning. They should be
      used in conjunction with Plans and Prices to configure pricing.
  - name: Plans
    description: >-
      Plans are collections of Prices which define the unit cost, currency, and
      (optional) billing cycle for both recurring and one-time purchases of
      Products. While Products help you track inventory or provisioning, plans
      and prices help you track payment terms. Different physical goods or
      levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing and
      billing cycle options should be represented by prices grouped together in
      a plan. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your
      provisioning scheme. For example, you might have a single ''Gold'' product
      that has prices for $100/month, $1000/year, and $50 once with the
      alternative billing cycle and pricing options each represented by a
      different plan and the recurring and one-time prices represented by
      different prices.
